# hello-world

Hello!

My name is Meenakshi and I'm from Dayton, Ohio. The reason I, personally, chose to pursue the CS50 computer science course is because computer science is everywhere. It takes part in something as simple as texting someone and in something as complex as creating website for a new business. And I want to be a part of that.
