Hello!

My name is Meenakshi and I'm from Dayton, Ohio! I really want to learn computer science because of the way our world is advancing and the impact I can make by knowing computer science. Computer science impacts everything from our fridge all the way to or bank manangement and I really want to be a part of that!
